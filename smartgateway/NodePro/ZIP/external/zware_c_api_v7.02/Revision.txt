--------------------                                     -----------------
-Improved send data function by using condition variable to wait for condition to send data.
-Multi-command encapsulation will be turned on automatically if a device supports multi-cmd.
-If the multi-command encapsulation mode is on and command queuing (for wake up command class)
 is on, all the commands for sending will be queued until the wake up notification is received.
 All the commands in the queue will then be encapsulated using multi-cmd for sending.
-If the multi-command encapsulation mode is on and command queuing (for wake up command class)
 is off, all the commands for sending will be sent after 1 second timeout.  If there is only one
 command for sending, the command will not be encapsulated using multi-cmd; otherwise, they will
 be sent using multi-cmd encapsulation.
-Allow application to check the current state of the multi-cmd mode.
-Support waiting for response (report) to a GET command before sending another command
 in nodes that requires wakeup beam.
-Assign return route will only be sent after the group add command has completed.  This
 prevents the assign return route messages from interrupting the security message nonce get,
 nonce report, security encapsulation sequence.
-Increase the maximum wait time for sending a command from 3 seconds to 7 seconds, due to Z/IP
 router requires about 5 seconds to send assign return route for node which requires wakeup beam.
-Sending a command will wait until the completion of previous add/delete return route.
-Added a thread in application layer to callback higher layer to report send completion status.
 This allows the callback function to send multiple commands without blocking the subsequent
 send completion status.
-On Linux platform, socket descriptor will be set with FD_CLOSEXEC option which specifies
 that the file descriptor should be closed when an exec function is invoked.
-Use WSAStringToAddress() to replace inet_pton() for WindowsXP SP3 compatibility.

 after a node was added securely.
-Changed makefile to generate 32-bit binary code in OS X platform.

Release version 5.01                                      Date: 7 Oct 2015
--------------------                                     -----------------
-When calling zwnet_exit(), set flags to stop processing at various layers.
-Changed zwnet_exit() to release all "waiting to send Z/IP packets" threads from blocking,
 instead of waiting them to timeout.

Release version 5.02                                      Date: 19 Oct 2015
--------------------                                     -----------------
-Ensured user application is safe to call any API functions (except zwnet_init & zwnet_exit) in all type of callbacks
 (e.g. network node added/removed callback, node status callback, report callback from device, network status callback, etc).
-Added post-set polling for doorlock and multi-level switch.
-Save to persistent storage on network changes (i.e. add/remove nodes, node update, etc).
-Changed zwnet_exit() to wait for all threads to exit (no timeout) before freeing network resources.
-Implemented "background polling" -- 10 seconds polling of each "always on" device, 12 hours polling of "FLIR" device
 and on-wakeup polling of sleeping device.

Release version 5.03                                      Date: 9 Nov 2015
--------------------                                     -----------------
-DTLS listening socket binds to an IPv6 address that is route-able to Z/IP gateway.  This is to ensure
 that all the handshaking messages will use the same source IPv6 address.
-Changed demo apps to display context sensitive menu.
-Changed demo app "gw_discovery" to accept option: -4 for using IPv4; -6 for using IPv6; default to IPv6 without option given.
-For portal mode, changed the network error callback to be called from same callback thread as network operation notification.
-Added network resource reference count mechanism to prevent invalid access to freed memory if the callback thread is
 held by user application longer than the zwnet_exit can wait the callback thread to exit.
-Narrowed post-set polling for multi-level switch to GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL && SPECIFIC_TYPE_CLASS_A/B/C_MOTOR_CONTROL
-Allow all the supported_get functions to try to get cached/device database data regardless of command class version.
-Allow the insertion of JSON items before "device_records" in device database file.
-Removed the requirement to supply zwnet_init_t.node_info_file in zwnet_init() to store network and node info
 into persistent storage.  Instead, the directory path zwnet_init_t.net_info_dir is required.
-Removed zwnet_load() as this API has been merged to zwnet_init().
-Removed zwnet_save() as saving of network and node info into persistent storage is managed by ZWARE lib.
-Use the present of COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY to determine whether the node is secure. Previously, the present of
 security command class marker (0xF100) was used.

-Changed all network operations to have higher priority than background device polling.
-Modified demo apps to support Security 2.

 security 2 mode.
-Changed persistent storage to store s2_keys_valid and s2_grnt_keys fields in node descriptor.
-Modified demo app to support S2 add node.
-Modified device background polling to remove invalid node from polling list.

 to have NULL report callback function for the purpose of alarm to doorlock report conversion and basic_set handling.

Release version 6.06                                      Date: 6 Jan 2016
